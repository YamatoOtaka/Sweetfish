## Installation

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate `Sweetfish` into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "YamatoOtaka/Sweetfish"
```

Run `carthage bootstrap` to build the framework in your repository's Carthage directory. You can then include it in your target's `carthage copy-frameworks` build phase. For more information on this, please see [Carthage's documentation](https://github.com/carthage/carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).
